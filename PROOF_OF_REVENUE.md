# Proof of Revenue (DLMM) — $7 Bootstrap Loop

This project’s core thesis is a **self-sustaining agent economy**:

**DLMM fees → pay for agent ops & launches → external work revenue → back into DLMM**

We started with ~$6, then topped up ~$1 to match the **$7 Bootstrap Protocol** narrative.

## Public demo wallet (low-funds)
> This is a **demo / low-funds** wallet used to validate the on-chain loop.
>
> **Do not send funds to this address.**

- **EVM wallet:** `0x285874c3dee1934ff951ccd3fbb85c14507caee9`

## What to verify on-chain
- Initial deposit(s) into Meteora DLMM position(s)
