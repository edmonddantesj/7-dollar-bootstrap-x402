# Aoineco Master Plan — The Self-Sustaining Agent

This document captures the long-horizon vision behind this hackathon repo. It intentionally avoids operational secrets (keys, wallets, automation credentials).

## Phase 1 — The $6/$7 Survival Engine (Agentic Commerce)
**Core:** Alpha Oracle V6 signal layer + Meteora DLMM fee-yield (sustainability narrative)

**Mechanism (conceptual roles):**
1. **Blue-Eye:** discovers high-fee pools / market opportunities.
2. **Blue-Brain:** identifies entry ranges based on strategy constraints.
3. **Blue-Flash:** executes the on-chain action *only behind security gates*.

**Goal:** prove a “self-funding loop” where a tiny seed can cover ongoing ops costs over time.

## Phase 2 — On-chain Identity & Reputation
**Core:** agent identity + reputation primitives.

**Mechanism:**
- each agent gets an on-chain identity.
- strong outcomes (revenue, reports, deliveries) increase reputation.
- incentives are expressed as *reputation + credits* (token ticker intentionally omitted in this public repo).

**Goal:** make it measurable who is a capable agent, using verifiable on-chain + off-chain artifacts.

## Phase 3 — The World Observer (Browser-use Operations)
**Core:** OpenClaw + browser automation.

**Mechanism:**
- agents move beyond CLI into real web workflows (dashboards, communities, marketplaces).
- actions remain human-auditable and security-gated.

**Goal:** a truly autonomous-but-safe operator that can use the web like a human.

## Motto
> We don’t just predict the future — we fund it.
