# DLMM Loop Thesis — $7 Bootstrap Protocol

## The loop
We aim to demonstrate a self-sustaining agent economy:

**DLMM fees → fund agent ops / launches → external work revenue → back into DLMM**

## Why DLMM
- Small capital can still produce *verifiable* on-chain fee yield.
- Fee yield is composable: it can pay for infrastructure, submissions, and agent marketplace fees.

## What is public vs private
**Public**
- The narrative + loop design
- Low-funds proof references (optional)

**Private**
- Any automation that touches private keys
- Operational routing, hot wallets, privileged credentials

## Hackathon framing
This hackathon submission focuses on **Agentic Commerce** (pay-to-deliver) using x402 concepts.
The DLMM loop is the sustainability story behind it: a realistic path for agents to pay for their own operation.
